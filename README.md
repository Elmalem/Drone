## About the project:

In this assignment, we had to improve code from two years ago for the Drone Simulator.
The Drone moves autonomously and now, after some improvements, doesn't get stuck in the walls, but you'll have to see for yourself ...


## How to use the project:

* Download the project zip to your eclipse or intellij

* In class "Config", change the "imageSourcePath" to yours (where you store the maps and the drone jpg files).

* Click "Toogle Ai"
